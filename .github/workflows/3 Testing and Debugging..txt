Testing and Debugging.

	* Testing and debugging are seperate activities.

* Testing can trigger failures that are caused by defects in the software or can directly find defects in the test object.

* When dynamic testing triggers a failure, debugging is concerned with finding causes of this failure, analyzing these causes, and eliminating them.

* the typical debugging process in the case involves:
  -> Reproduction of a failure
  -> Diagnosis (finding the root cause)
  -> Fixing the cause

* WHen satic testing identifies a defect, debugging is concerned with removing it. There is no need for reproduction or diagnosis, since static testing directly finds defects, and cannot cause failures.
